## Mock Data

This repository already includes a Nitro project inside the `api/` folder.  
That server provides mock API endpoints for you to consume in your React project. 

To start the mock API, navigate into the `api/` directory and run the Nitro dev server.

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll evaluate your submission as a whole - not only the final result, but also how it reflects your understanding of the problem and your ability to turn ambiguous requirements into a coherent, maintainable product experience.  
There are no hidden requirements or preferred libraries. Build it as you would in a real environment where the goal is clarity, reliability, and usability.

## Submission

To submit your work, fork this repository, complete the assignment in your fork, and share the link to your fork with us. You may also include a live deployment if you'd like (for example, on Vercel or Netlify).
